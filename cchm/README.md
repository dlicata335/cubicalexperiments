Things you definitely will need to edit for old code:
- rename Id to Path
- change comp A b [T] to comp (<_> A) ... b [T] 

Tasks:

- There are a bunch of wholes in Prelude.ctt of things that used to type
  check but now don't, but these aren't the easiest / most intuitive
  places to start.  

- Finish circle12

- Total space of hopf fibration

- pi_4(S3)
